# BioALBERT
BioALBERT- A simple and effective pre-trained biomedical language representation model


This repository provides the pre-trained BioALBERT models, a biomedical language representation model trained on large domain specific (biomedical) corpora for designed for biomedical text mining tasks.


## Download

We provide four versions of pre-trained weights. Pre-training was based on the original ALBERT code, and training details are described in our paper (To be Published). Currently available versions of pre-trained weights are as follows:

1) *BioALBERT-Base v1.0 (PubMed) - based on ALBERT-base Model*

2) *BioALBERT-Base v1.0 (PubMed + PMC) - based on ALBERT-base Model*

3) *BioALBERT-Large v1.1 (PubMed) - based on ALBERT-Large Model*

4) *BioALBERT-Large v1.1 (PubMed + PMC) - based on ALBERT-Large Model*
